This repository contains a simple Tcl script demonstrating a stack overflow error caused by uncontrolled recursion. The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version. The issue stems from a missing base case in the recursive call, leading to infinite recursion.  The solution introduces a check to prevent recursion when the input is 0 or negative, effectively handling the base case and preventing the stack overflow.
